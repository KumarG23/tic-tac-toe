# tictactoe psuedo

## must haves

draw board []
state - "", "x", "o"
Reset
click event for adding x and o
if x or o is already there we cant click it again
check for win 3 in a row
check for draw when all spaces are taken
display who wins after win
display 'cat' when there is a draw

## could haves

I would like something other than x's and o's
a cooler win screen
display an actual cat when there is a tie
add a sound when someone wins or ties
